The plan is to be clearly articulated and include an organizational chart,
administrative timeline, and a description of how the project will be governed,
as well as a strategy to enhance coordination, collaboration, communication, and
data sharing and reporting among members of the project team and stakeholder
groups. The plan must also address how the project will be sustained beyond
termination of an award. 

The management plan must also include an advisory group of principal
stakeholders, partners, and professionals to assess and evaluate the quality,
expected measurable outcomes, and potential impacts for the proposed research,
education and/or extension. Please include rationale for their role, and how
they will function effectively to support the goals and objectives of the
project. The plan must demonstrate how partners and stakeholders contribute to
project assessment on an annual basis.
