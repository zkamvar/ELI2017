\maketitle

The Primary Mentor's laboratory is fully equipped for microbiology, molecular genetics, and fungicide studies. The laboratory contains a level-2 biosafety cabinet, a fume hood, and is equipped with the AutoPlate 5000 (Advanced Instruments Inc.), a specialized instrument used for creating a gradient of fungicide concentrations on media. There is a precision growth chamber and ambient temperature growth racks for fungal growth, and the laboratory also contains dissecting and compound microscopes, a cold room, cooler, refrigerator, freezer, and a $-80^{\circ}C$  freezer for maintaining stock collections. The laboratory has a Thermo Scientific bench top microcentrifuge, waterbath, drying oven, and three tandem Eppendorf Mastercylcer Nexus gradient PCR machines. The Primary Mentor's laboratory contains a Qubit fluorometer for high sensitivity and broad spectrum nucleic acid quantification, and the PD has access to both a departmental Nanodrop spectrophotometer for nucleic acid quantification and gel documentation instrument.
