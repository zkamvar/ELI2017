\maketitle

The primary mentor's laboratory is fully equipped for microbiology, molecular genetics, and fungicide studies. The laboratory contains a level-2 biosafety cabinet and fume hood, and is equipped with the AutoPlate 5000 (Advanced Instruments Inc.), a specialized instrument used for creating a gradient of fungicide concentrations on media. The laboratory also has a precision growth chamber and ambient temperature growth racks for fungal growth, and contains dissecting and compound microscopes, a cold room, cooler, refrigerator, freezer, and -$80^{\circ}C$ freezer for maintaining stock collections. The laboratory has a Thermo Scientific bench top microcentrifuge, waterbath, drying oven, and three tandem Eppendorf Mastercylcer Nexus gradient PCR machines. The primary mentor's laboratory also has a Qubit fluorometer for high-sensitivity and broad-spectrum nucleic acid quantification. Finally, the PD has access to both a departmental Nanodrop spectrophotometer for nucleic acid quantification and a gel documentation instrument.
