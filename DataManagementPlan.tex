The DMP should clearly articulate how the project director (PD) and co-PDs plan
to manage and disseminate data generated by the project. NIFA and reviewers will
consider the DMP during the merit review process. NIFA is aware of the need to
provide flexibility in assessing DMPs. The DMP should contain the following
components.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Expected Data Type} Describe the type of data (e.g., digital,
	non- digital), how they will be generated, and whether the data are primary
	or metadata. Examples include: for research, lab work, field work and
	surveys; for education, number of students enrolled/participated, degrees
	granted, curriculum, and training products; for extension, outreach
	materials, number of stakeholders reached, number of activities, and
	assessment questionnaires.
  \item \textbf{Data Format}
	For data to be readily accessible and usable, it is critical to use an
	appropriate community-recognized standard and machine readable formats when
	they exist. The data should preferentially be stored in recognized public
	databases. Regardless of the format used that data set should contain enough
	information to allow independent use of the data.
  \item \textbf{Data Storage and Preservation}
	Data should be stored in a safe environment with adequate measures taken for
	its long-term preservation. Applicants should describe plans for storing and
	preserving their data during and after the project and specify the data
	repositories, if they exist. They should outline strategies, tools, and
	contingency plans that will be used to avoid data loss, degradation, or
	damage.
  \item \textbf{Data Sharing and Public Access}
	Describe your data access and sharing procedures during and after the grant.
	Provide any restrictions such as copyright, confidentiality, patent,
	appropriate credit, disclaimers, or conditions for use of the data by other
	parties.
  \item \textbf{Roles and Responsibilities}
	Who will ensure DMP implementation? This is particularly important for
	multi- investigator and multi-institutional projects. Provide a contingency
	plan in case key personnel leave the project. Also, what resources will be
	needed for the DMP? If funds are needed, have they been added to the budget
	request and budget narrative? Projects must budget sufficient resources to
	develop and implement the proposed DMP.

\end{itemize}
