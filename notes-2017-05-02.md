# Notes from a discussion with Sydney

Focusing on an integrated application is a good way to go because the committee
might decide that I already have enough genomics experience. 

Instead of proposing a teaching workshop or class, instead, what's really needed
is community building. This can be accomplished by creating a resource like the
website https://popgen.nescent.org

The key is that it should be aimed at plant pathologists, so not just population
genetics work, but even simple things like how to do an ANOVA or a disease 
progress curve.

K. Garett and A. Sparks already have a primer on APS for doing analyses in R, but
these are only provided by them and are static. What is needed is a community
driven resource that encourages people to share their data and analyses.

Sydney had the idea that we could encourage people to use this resource as a way
to share the data and analyses that they have for their talks/posters at the
annual meeting.

Even better, this could be a workshop designed for before or after the meeting 
so that people can bring their data and analyses and create a massive amount of 
content for the website.

The beauty abou this is that it doesn't necessarily need to be confined to analyses
in R, but it can be ANYTHING as long as it's open source and able to be run on a
server. So, you could have a program in Python, Perl, or Julia and have everything
come out allright.
