Background
----------

Of all the AFRI grants, this is the only one applicable to both Ph. D. students
and, more importantly in this case, postdoctoral researchers. One of the major
things to remember about this funding is that they are not necessarily funding
the PROJECT, they are funding the RESEARCHER. This gives me a lot more freedom
than I would have otherwise.

Because of this, they are generally interested in how the funding can help
prepare me to be a more well-rounded researcher in the future. There are three
types of grants that they offer, research, education, and integrated grants. I'm
planning to engage in an integrated project that will combine research of
*Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* in temperate and tropical regions of North America
and East Asia along with the building of educational resources for reproducible
research and open science in plant pathology.
