\section{Training/Career Development Plan}

% The Training/Career Development Plan is a description of all activities that
% the applicant plans to perform and participate to enhance the pre- or
% postdoctoral training during the fellowship award period.

% For Postdoctoral Fellowship applicants, a Training/Career Development Plan
% includes plans for transition to career independence by development of
% professional skills. These professional skills include teaching competencies;
% what those career and training goals are; and results of the postdoctoral
% fellow's previous and current research and scholarships that include
% publications, presentations, etc.


The proposed research aims to understand the evolutionary history of the plant pathogenic fungus \textit{Sclerotinia sclerotiorum} across continents and climate regions. 
By conducting this research openly, I can use the data and analyses as source materials to create educational activities. 
These will be focused on the topic of reproducible and open research in genomic data analysis,
which will be taught as a series of workshops at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
A summary of the course will additionally be published in the
journal \textit{Plant Health Instructor}. 
\textbf{My overall goals for this fellowship are to develop my skills in education and genomic-scale research.} 


\subsection{Research Training}

Broadly, my current research focuses on understanding the population dynamics and evolutionary processes governing the clonally-reproducing fungal pathogen \textit{S. scleroitoriorum}.
However, I do not have substantial experience performing large-scale genomic data analysis. \textbf{The goal of research training} is to compliment my skills as a data scientist with the tools and techniques necessary for evolutionary genomic data analysis. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Background Training In: } population genetics, evolution, molecular techniques, microbiological techniques, and R programming
  \item \textbf{Experienced In: } reproducible research techniques, methods development, cluster computing, population genetic analysis, software development, multivariate analysis
  \item \textbf{Inexperienced In: } genomic data analysis, coalescent analysis,
  Bayesian statistics, phylogeographic analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Research Training Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Pedagogical Training}

I have experience teaching short, 3 hour workshops, but don't have formal training in pedagogical methods beyond my training as a Teaching Assistant for a 200 level introductory biology course. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Background Training In: } Assignment evaluation, laboratory section management
  \item \textbf{Experienced In: } Interactive laboratory instruction, K-12 English as a Foreign Language instruction, Short-form workshop development and
  instruction
  \item \textbf{Inexperienced In: } Active learning techniques, course creation and evaluation, developing goals for specific learning outcomes, course portfolio development
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pedagogical Training Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Workshop training} will be provided by Data Carpentry. In my first year, I aim to complete instructor training and certification.
  \item \textbf{Pedagogical training} can be achieved by signing up for the Peer Review of Teaching Project at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Career Development}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Background Training In: } manuscript preparation, peer-review process, research ethics, outreach methods
  \item \textbf{Experienced In: } professional writing (CV, r\'esum\'e, cover letters), written and oral communication of scientific research to professional and lay audiences, leadership
  \item \textbf{Inexperienced In: } research grant writing, course development, grant budget management, inter-organizational leadership
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Career Development Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Professional Development} will be ...
\end{enumerate}


My doctoral research was focused on developing tools for the population genetic
analysis of clonal organisms. The explicit goal of the research was to provide
resources to allow researcher to perform their analyses in a reproducible manner
\citep{kamvar2014poppr}.

I plan to use this fellowship to conduct research on the plant pathogenic
fungus, \textit{Sclerotinia sclerotiorum} in temperate and subtropical regions
of East Asia and North America to determine if differentiation between
populations can be explained more by geography or climate. From this research, I
will be able to develop a peer-reviewed module focused on analysis of genomic
data for the American Phytopathological Society Education Center.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Understanding population dynamics and evolutionary processes governing fungal plant pathogens
  \item Championing open science practices in agricultural sciences through community action
\end{itemize}

\section{Mentoring Plan}

The applicants are expected to engage their mentors and/or advisors in the
development of their application. Thus, prior to submission of the
application, prospective fellows should already identify a Primary mentor who
will be willing to help them in their projects as well as professional
development (note: more than one Primary Mentor is acceptable for Integrated
Projects Only). If there are other collaborating mentors, their role and
responsibilities to the project and development of the applicant's skills
should be clearly described. For predoctoral applications, if the primary
mentor is not the student's graduate advisor or laboratory sponsor, the
relationship between advisor's work and the primary mentor's research should
be clearly defined, and the contribution of each individual in the student's
project as well as degree completion should be included. Because this is a
very important component of the project, the commitment of the mentor(s) is
included in the evaluation criteria as it pertains to project personnel. In
describing the role of the mentor, the applicant should:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Briefly indicate how the mentoring and educational training will add to the
   skill sets of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Fellow.

  \item Briefly explain the commitment of the primary mentor.

  \item Briefly describe the role of collaborating mentors (if applicable).

  \item With respect to the Primary Mentor, provide a list of former mentees and
   their current positions. 
   \begin{quote}
   NOTE: The Primary Mentor shall submit a Letter of Commitment (as an
   attachment to Field 12, Other Attachments, of the Other Project
   Information form-see section g. in the AFRI ELI RFA) explicitly
   indicating their respective responsibilities throughout the proposed
   project in relation to the Project Director.
   \end{quote}

  \item Briefly list and explain the role of other non-primary mentors.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Project Plan}

The research should be totally independent of the mentor's. Proven techniques
and technologies as part of the experimental approach, especially if these are
routinely employed, don't have to be provided in detail. Experimental
approaches or strategies including possible pitfalls and alternatives must be
provided in order to assess the overall feasibility of the Updated March 10,
2017 proposed study. Avoid open-ended screens or undefined outcomes. The scope
of the project should be within the 2-year timeframe.

\noindent \textbf{Research objectives}

\textit{Sclerotinia sclerotiorum} is a plant pathogenic soil fungus with over 400 hosts worldwide including soybean and canola. 
Effective management strategies depend on the knowledge of genetic diversity and sexual reproduction.
Numerous studies over the last 30 years around the world show diversity in subtropical regions, but \cite{lehner2017sclerotinia} shows that this may be an artifact of low resolution genetic markers.
Several studies have been conducted either across continental or climate regions, but no studies have addressed if the differences observed between \textit{S. sclerotiorum} populations is due to climate or region. 
\textbf{The two-pronged goal} of the proposed research is to determine if subtropical regions exhibit more diversity and outcrossing than temperate regions and use the research products to develop a course on reproducible methods for genomic data analysis.

\noindent
\textbf{Objective \#1:} Perform whole genome sequencing on 96 isolates collected hierarchically over 8 subpopulations in North America and East Asia, respectively (Fig. \ref{fig:us-china}).\\
\textbf{Objective \#2:} Using \textit{Botrytis cinerea} as an outgroup, perform phylogeographic and coalescent analyses to determine if divergence is due to climate or geography.\\
\textbf{Objective \#3:} Use the research products of objectives 1 \& 2 to create educational materials for graduate students that covers topics from
data validation and curation, method choice, version control, and open data science practices.

We plan to infer genetic diversity, migration patterns, and outcrossing with modern, reproducible population genetic and phylogeographic approaches on whole genome sequence data. 

The long-term goals of the research are to \textbf{a)} provide fine-scale knowledge of diversity within \textit{S. sclerotiorum} across climate regions within continents and \textbf{b)} to provide educational materials for the training of graduate students in reproducible research. 

\subsection{Rationale and Significance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Concisely present the rationale behind the proposed project and how it will
  advance the current knowledge in the field;

  \item Clearly describe the specific relationship of the project's objectives to
  one of the Program Area Priorities. The Program Area Priority(ies) must be
  specifically identified
\end{itemize}

%  AFRI Foundational Priority for....
    % - Plant health and production and plant products;
    % - Animal health and production and animal products;
    % - Food safety, nutrition, and health;
    % - Bioenergy, natural resources, and environment;
    % - Agriculture systems and technology;
    % - Agriculture economics and rural communities

\textbf{AFRI Foundational Priority for Plant Health and Production and Plant Products}

The rationale of the proposed work is twofold: to identify determinants of local adaptation in global populations of \textit{S. sclerotiorum} and to use these data and analyses to create an open lesson plan focused on empowering the next generation of scientists to perform reliable, reproducible research. 
For over 15 years, population genetic analysis on \textit{S. sclerotiorum} has been performed using the same set of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers \citep{sirjusingh2001characterization}. 
These markers, however, are unable to accurately determine the number of unique genotypes in a sample \citep{lehner2017independently,lehner2017sclerotinia,arnaud2007standardizing}.   
Losses in North Dakota alone due to \textit{S. sclerotiorum} averaged to \$2.95 million per year between the years of 2003 to 2005 \cite{ramasubramaniam2008estimates}. On average, there is an annual loss of 18.5 million bushels of soybean per year \footnote{\url{http://extension.cropsciences.illinois.edu/fieldcrops/diseases/yield_reductions.php}}.
Management practices require knowledge of the determinants of local adaptation. 
By using whole genome sequencing, we additionally provide a form of data that can easily be reused to answer questions of a broader evolutionary scope not addressed in this proposal. 
This means that research dollars and work hours that would normally be spent collecting data could be spent analyzing data and training students. 
The educational component of this project is aimed explicitly at training graduate students seeking masters or doctoral degrees on how to perform open and reproducible research. 
By crafting and automating the data validation and statistical analyses, researchers can focus more energy on ensuring that the methods they use are appropriate and the results they produce are correct. 
Open science has long-term broad effects of increased confidence among stakeholders. 


% Educational components must address one or two of the following key
% strategic actions:
% - Train students for Associate, Baccalaureate, Master's or Doctoral
% degrees; and/or
% - Prepare K-12 teachers and higher education faculty to understand and
% present food and agricultural scienc

training/career development plan, mentoring plan, and project plan. The plan
must include milestones, which signify the completion of a major deliverable,
events, or accomplishment and serve to verify that the project is on schedule
and on track for successful conclusion. The plan should also include
descriptions of indicators that will be measured to evaluate whether the
education activities are successful in achieving project goals and contribute
to the achievement of the stated program goals and outcomes; and a
dissemination plan describing the methods that will be used to communicate
findings and project accomplishments.

In addition to the Project Narrative requirements above, the proposed
Integrated Project should clearly articulate:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Stakeholder involvement in project development, implementation, and
   evaluation, where appropriate;

  \item Objectives for each function included in the project (note that extension
   and education activities are expected to differ and to be described as
   separate project objectives; see enumerated descriptions in Part II, C
   (page 7 in the AFRI ELI RFA); and Updated March 10, 2017

  \item A dissemination plan describing the methods that will be used to
   communicate findings and project accomplishments.

  \item A plan for evaluating progress toward achieving project objectives must be
   included. The plan must include milestones, which signify the completion of
   a major deliverable, event, or accomplishment and serve to verify that the
   project is on schedule and on track for successful conclusion. The plan
   should also include descriptions of indicators that you will measure to
   evaluate whether the research, education, and/or extension activities are
   successful in achieving project goals and in contributing to achievement of
   the stated program goals and outcomes.
