\subsubsection{Developing a Reproducible Research Curriculum From Real-World Examples in Agriculture}

The ``reproducibility crisis'' in science, in which results presented in publications cannot be reproduced with the same data and methods, has severely impacted public perception of scientific research in the United States.
Agricultural science research often has direct impacts on the producers, and it is imperative that these stakeholders hold trust in the results. 
The goals of this project is to (1) use modern active learning techniques and real-world examples to create a curriculum of reproducible research for students of agriculture and (2) Use a genomic investigation of local adaptation in the plant pathogenic fungus \textit{Sclerotinia sclerotiorum} as an example of fully open and reproducible research.
\textit{S. sclerotiorum} is a cosmopolitan necrotrophic fungus that infects >400 plant species and is the causal agent of Sclerotinia Stem Rot on canola, causing millions of dollars in damage in the US annually.
Genetic studies with ow resolution markers have shown that populations in China and the US are significantly differentiated, but these happened to be from sub-tropical and temperate climates, respectively. 
We hypothesize that these differences are driven by local adaptation to climate. 
We propose to sequence 96 isolates of \textit{S. sclerotiorum} across temperate and sub-tropical regions in the US and China. 
Tests for genomic signatures of local adaptation will be done using population genetic methods including the coalescent, phylogeographic methods, and variance partitioning.
By performing these analyses in an open and reproducible manner, we will (1) provide well-documented and curated raw genomic data for future analyses and (2) set an example of how large-scale genomic data can be analyzed in an open and reproducible manner.
Project results will include 96 whole genome sequences of \textit{S. sclerotiorum}, an insight into patterns of local adaptation of global populations of \textit{S. sclerotiorum}, and a reproducible research curriculum that will aid in improving research practices, which will increase stakeholder trust in the long term.
