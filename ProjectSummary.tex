\subsubsection*{Developing a Reproducible Research Curriculum From Real-World Examples in Agriculture}

Agricultural science research often directly impacts agricultural producers, and thus, it is imperative that production stakeholders are able to trust the viability and integrity of agricultural research. 
The practice of open and reproducible research, where all steps of the scientific process are made freely available and verifiable, holds many benefits for scientists including increased public confidence in science. 
The goals of this integrated post-doctoral project include: 1) creating a course on reproducible research using modern, active-learning techniques that utilize real-world examples in agriculture and (2) developing an example of a fully open and reproducible research project using a genomic investigation of thermal adaptation in the cosmopolitan plant pathogenic fungus \textit{Sclerotinia sclerotiorum} across the United States and China. 
\textit{S. sclerotiorum} is the causal agent of Sclerotinia Stem Rot and infects over 400 plant species, causing millions of dollars in damage in the United States, annually. 
Because understanding thermal adaptation will help management decisions in a changing climate and training in reproducible practices will have the long-term effect of improving the quality of scientific research, this project falls within the ``plant health and production and plant products'' foundational area. 
Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Everhart (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), this project will enhance my skills in science education and genomics research, preparing me well for a successful transition to a faculty position, and fulfilling the goal of the fellowship program to train the next generation of agricultural scientists.
