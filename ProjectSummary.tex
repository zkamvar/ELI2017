\subsubsection*{Developing a Reproducible Research Curriculum From Real-World Examples in Agriculture}

Agricultural science research often has direct impacts on the producers, and thus, it is imperative that these stakeholders hold trust in the results. 
The practice of open and reproducible research, where all steps of the scientific process are made freely available and verifiable, holds many benefits for scientists including increased public confidence in science.
The goals of this project is to (1) create a course on reproducible research for students of agriculture using modern active learning techniques with real-world examples and (2) create one example of fully open and reproducible research using a genomic investigation of local adaptation in the plant pathogenic fungus \textit{Sclerotinia sclerotiorum}.
\textit{S. sclerotiorum} is a cosmopolitan necrotrophic fungus that infects >400 plant species and is the causal agent of Sclerotinia Stem Rot on canola, causing millions of dollars in damage in the US annually.
Genetic studies with low resolution markers have shown that populations in China and the US are significantly differentiated, but these happened to be from sub-tropical and temperate climates, respectively. 
We hypothesize that these differences are driven by local adaptation to climate. 
We propose to sequence 96 isolates of \textit{S. sclerotiorum} across temperate and sub-tropical regions in the US and China. 
Tests for genomic signatures of local adaptation will be done using population genetic methods including the coalescent, phylogeographic methods, and variance partitioning.
By performing these analyses in an open and reproducible manner, we will (1) provide well-documented and curated raw genomic data for future analyses and (2) set an example of how large-scale genomic data can be analyzed in an open and reproducible manner.
This research will help my career by providing me with the opportunity for pedagogical training, which will help become an effective teacher and mentor in a future faculty position.
Project outcomes will include 96 whole genome sequences of \textit{S. sclerotiorum}, an insight into patterns of local adaptation of global populations of \textit{S. sclerotiorum}, and a reproducible research curriculum that will aid in improving research practices, which will increase stakeholder trust in the long term.
